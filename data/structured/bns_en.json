Here  A  is  not\nguilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z, and therefore the\ncase  falls  within  the  general  exception  which  provides  that  “nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  by  a\nperson who is bound by law to do it”.\n(2)  Every  expression  which  is  explained  in  any  Part  of  this  Sanhita,  is  used  in  every  Part  of  this\nSanhita in conformity with the explanation.\n(3)  When  property  is  in  the  possession  of  a  person’s  spouse,  clerk  or  servant,  on  account  of  that\nperson, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.\nExplanation.—A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk\nor servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section.\n(4) In every Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words\nwhich refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.\n(5)  When  a  criminal  act  is  done  by  several  persons  in  furtherance  of  the  common  intention  of  all,\neach of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.\n(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or\nintention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or\nintention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge\nor intention.\n(7) Wherever  the  causing of  a  certain  effect,  or  an attempt  to cause  that effect,  by  an  act  or  by  an\nomission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by\nan omission is the same offence.\nIllustration.\nA intentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by beating Z.\nA has committed murder.\n(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the\ncommission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person,\ncommits that offence.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison.\nA  and  B  administer  the  poison  according  to  the  agreement  with  intent  to  murder  Z.  Z  dies  from  the\neffects the several doses of poison so administered to him.

A and B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally\nomitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.\nZ dies of hunger.

A,  intending  to  cause  Z’s  death,  illegally  omits  to\nsupply  Z  with  food;  in  consequence  of  which  Z  is  much  reduced  in  strength,  but  the  starvation  is  not\nsufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or\ncooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s\ndeath. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an\nattempt to commit murder.\n(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be\nguilty of different offences by means of that act.\nIllustration.\nA  attacks  Z  under  such  circumstances  of  grave  provocation  that  his  killing  of  Z  would  be  only\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes\nhim with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder,\nalthough the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a\nperson in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him\nsuch a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A,\nalthough he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death,\nor such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the\nordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have\nintended to cause Z’s death.\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is\nguilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.\nException  1.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender,  whilst  deprived  of  the  power  of\nself-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or\ncauses the death of any other person by mistake or accident:\nProvided that the provocation is not,—\n(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any\nperson;\n(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise\nof the powers of such public servant;\n(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\nExplanation.—Whether the  provocation  was  grave and  sudden  enough  to  prevent the offence  from\namounting to murder is a question of fact.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y,\nZ’s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of\nthe child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither\nintending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here\nA has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest,\nand  kills  Z.  This  is  murder,  in  as  much  as  the  provocation  was  given  by  a  thing  done  by  a  public\nservant in the exercise of his powers.\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A’s\ndeposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z.\nThis is murder.\n(e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to\nprevent  him  from  doing  so.  A  is  moved to  sudden  and  violent  passion  in  consequence,  and  kills  Z.\nThis is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of\nprivate defence.\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take\nadvantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that purpose. B kills Z\nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the\nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.\nIllustration.\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol.\nZ persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from\nbeing horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.\nException  3.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender,  being  a  public  servant  or  aiding  a\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and\ncauses  death  by  doing  an  act  which  he,  in  good  faith,  believes  to  be  lawful  and  necessary  for  the  due\ndischarge  of  his  duty  as  such  public  servant  and  without  ill-will  towards  the  person  whose  death  is\ncaused.\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden\nfight  in  the  heat  of  passion  upon  a  sudden  quarrel  and  without  the  offender’s  having  taken  undue\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first\nassault.\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.\nIllustration.\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he\nwas incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.",

Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has\ncommitted theft.\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if A’s intention\nbe dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A has committed theft as soon\nas Z’s dog has begun to follow A.\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order\nthat he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft\nof the treasure.\n(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the\nplate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.\n(e)  Z,  going  on  a journey, entrusts  his  plate to  A, the  keeper  of  a  warehouse,  till  Z  shall  return. A\ncarries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession. It could not therefore\nbe taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal\nbreach of trust.\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z’s\npossession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits\nno theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the\nring  immediately  for  fear  of  search  and  detection,  A  hides  the  ring  in  a  place  where  it  is  highly\nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and\nselling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the\njeweler  any  debt  for  which  the  jeweler  might  lawfully  detain  the  watch  as  a  security,  enters  the  shop\nopenly,  takes  his  watch  by  force  out  of  Z’s  hand,  and  carries  it  away.  Here  A,  though  he  may  have\ncommitted criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not done\ndishonestly.\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for\nthe debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as\na security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, not\nhaving paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property in as\nmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with the intention of\nkeeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has\ntherefore committed theft.\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book\nwithout Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it.\nHere, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. If this\nwas A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to\nZ her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised to give away alms. If\nthis was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her\nhusband  Z,  and  to  be  such  property  as  she  has  no  authority  from  Z  to  give.

A, in order to defraud B, adds\ncipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote\nthe letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b)  A,  without  Z’s  authority,  affixes  Z’s  seal  to  a  document  purporting  to  be  a  conveyance  of  an\nestate  from  Z  to  A,  with  the  intention  of  selling  the  estate  to  B  and  thereby  of  obtaining  from  B  the\npurchase-money. A has committed forgery.\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been\ninserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A\ncommits forgery.\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable\nand  authorises  B  to  fill  up  the  cheque  by  inserting  a  sum  not  exceeding  ten  thousand  rupees  for  the\npurpose  of  making  certain  payments.  B  fraudulently  fills  up  the  cheque  by  inserting  the  sum  of\ntwenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e)  A  draws  a  bill  of  exchange  on  himself  in  the  name  of  B  without  B’s  authority,  intending  to\ndiscount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A\ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B,\nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f)  Z’s  will  contains  these  words—“I  direct  that  all  my  remaining  property  be  equally  divided\nbetween A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be believed that the\nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on\nthe bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words\n“Pay  to  Z  or  his  order”,  and  thereby  converts  the  special  endorsement  into  a  blank  endorsement.  B\ncommits forgery.\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a\nconveyance  of  the  same  estate  to  B,  dated  six  months  earlier  than  the  date  of  the  conveyance  to  Z,\nintending  it  to  be  believed  that  he  had  conveyed  the  estate  to  B  before  he  conveyed  it  to  Z.  A  has\ncommitted forgery.\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named\nby Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to\nsign the will. A has committed forgery.\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying that A is a man of\ngood character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such\nletter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to\npart with property, A has committed forgery.\n(k)  A  without  B’s  authority  writes  a  letter  and  signs  it  in  B’s  name  certifying  to  A’s  character,\nintending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to\ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract\nfor service.\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was\ndrawn by another person of the same name.

A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper\npursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n(c)  A  picks  up  a  bill  of  exchange  payable  to  the  order  of  a  different  person  of  the  same  name.  A\nendorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person\nto whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate,\nin collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates\nthe lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the\nlease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery\nby antedating it.\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and with intent to\ndefraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding\nhimself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to\nhave been made before A was on the point of insolvency.
